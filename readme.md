<p>Welcome & thank you for viewing my webpage</p>

#### This webpage is dedicated to one of my most-liked animals - Sharks - Inspired by one of my most memorable childhood movies - **JAWS**, which was released in 1975, and is the first movie directed by Steven Spielberg that I remember watching in the mid 80's!

###### The grey rectangle shadow underneath the 'SHARK SEMESTER' image of this Readme does **NOT** show on the webpage, and only shows on this readme image as a result of taking a screenshot of the webpage.
