            <h2>Care and Feeding of Tiger Sharks</h2>
            <p>Tiger sharks grow only to 15 feet, so they are much better suited as pet sharks for kids under the age of
                12.</p>

                <h2>Shark Maintenance Training Videos</h2>
                <p>Shark maintenance training videos offer invaluable insights into the care and management of these
                    magnificent creatures within aquariums and marine parks. These videos serve as essential resources
                    for aquarists, trainers, and marine biologists, providing detailed instructions on various aspects
                    of shark care, including feeding, habitat maintenance, behavioral training, and veterinary
                    procedures. By documenting best practices and innovative techniques, these videos contribute to the
                    advancement of shark husbandry and welfare standards worldwide.</p>
                <p>One key focus of shark maintenance training videos is behavioral conditioning, which involves
                    training sharks to participate willingly in routine health checks and medical procedures. Through
                    positive reinforcement techniques such as target training and operant conditioning, trainers can
                    encourage desirable behaviors while minimizing stress for the animals. These videos often showcase
                    the step-by-step process of training sessions, highlighting the bond between trainers and sharks and
                    demonstrating the effectiveness of positive reinforcement in shaping behavior.</p>
                <p>Additionally, shark maintenance training videos often emphasize the importance of environmental
                    enrichment to promote the physical and mental well-being of captive sharks. Enrichment activities,
                    such as novel feeding techniques, interactive toys, and simulated natural behaviors, help prevent
                    boredom and encourage the expression of natural instincts. By incorporating enrichment into daily
                    care routines, aquariums and marine parks can enhance the quality of life for their resident sharks,
                    promoting physical activity, mental stimulation, and overall health. Overall, shark maintenance
                    training videos play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of shark behavior and care
                    practices, ultimately contributing to the conservation of these remarkable animals.</p>

                <h2>Fun Facts about Tiger Sharks</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="bold">Distinctive Appearance:</span> Tiger sharks get their name from the dark,
                        vertical stripes found on their bodies, somewhat resembling a tiger's stripes. These stripes
                        fade as they mature, but they're quite striking when the sharks are young.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Large Size:</span> They are one of the largest shark species, with adults
                        typically ranging from 10 to 14 feet in length. Some individuals can grow even larger, reaching
                        lengths of up to 18 feet.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Varied Diet:</span> Tiger sharks are often referred to as the "garbage cans
                        of the sea" due to their voracious appetite and tendency to eat almost anything. Their diet
                        includes fish, sea turtles, seabirds, dolphins, and even other sharks. They've been known to
                        consume non-food items such as tires, license plates, and pieces of coal.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Amazing Sense of Smell:</span> Tiger sharks have an exceptional sense of
                        smell, even better than some other shark species. They can detect prey from great distances
                        using their highly sensitive nostrils.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Wide Distribution:</span> These sharks are found in tropical and temperate
                        waters around the world, inhabiting coastal areas, reefs, and the open ocean. They are commonly
                        seen in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Nocturnal Hunters:</span> While they can be active during the day, tiger
                        sharks are primarily nocturnal hunters. They often cruise near the ocean floor at night in
                        search of prey, using their excellent senses to locate food in low light conditions.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Impressive Speed and Agility:</span> Despite their bulky appearance, tiger
                        sharks are agile swimmers capable of bursts of speed when hunting. They can reach speeds of up
                        to 20-30 miles per hour (32-48 km/h) when chasing prey.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Long Lifespan:</span> Tiger sharks have relatively long lifespans compared to
                        other shark species, with some individuals living up to 30 years or more in the wild.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Reproduction:</span> Like many sharks, tiger sharks are slow to reach sexual
                        maturity and have relatively low reproductive rates. Females give birth to live young after a
                        gestation period of around 14-16 months, with litter sizes typically ranging from 10 to 80 pups.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Conservation Concerns:</span> While not currently listed as endangered, tiger
                        sharks face various threats including overfishing, habitat degradation, and accidental bycatch
                        in fishing gear. Conservation efforts are underway to better understand and protect these
                        important apex predators.</li>
